- 👋 I am very experienced in many areas of Automotive Industry, once I worked in Brazil and Germany at VW in Product Development, Product Marketing, Exports, Sales, Pricing, Finance, and so on.
-    I developed myself in many aspects in all of these areas, reaching high positions. Now I feel that programming I can put all this experience in Projects with much better understanding
-    than a single programmer, as I have the point of view of many areas involved in the projects, a more global vision of the business. This is something you don't learn in a few days.
- 👋 I also am very interested in AI, GPT Prompts and so on.
- 👋 That's all! If there's something I can help you, let's book a call, it will be a pleasure!
